# bhumba-board

This component renders a visualization of a Battlesnake-compatible board state.

The rendering is done using an inline SVG document, similar to Battlesnake's official board viewer, but this one is much more basic and does not aim to re-implement all features.

Food and uneliminated snakes will be rendered. Eliminated snakes will not be rendered.
